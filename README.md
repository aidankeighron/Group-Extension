# Group Extension
 
This Google Chrome extension was created to help transfer tab data across devices. Google has a feature where you can group tabs together (you can create a group by right-clicking on a tab and selecting "Add tab to group"). I use this feature heavily, and I often have many groups each with a set of tabs related to the group name. When I switch from my laptop to my desktop or any other computer, I have to re-open all of the grouped tabs, which can take a while and is an overall hassle. So I made this extension to help with that.

# How to use

When you click on the extension, it opens a popup allowing you to select a group to save or load. The save table shows a list of all the current groups (even groups in other windows), pressing one of the buttons will save the corresponding group. Clicking any of the buttons in the load table will load that saved group. The X next to each load button will delete that group. Pressing the clear button will remove all saved groups.

# How to install

The easiest way is to install it through the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/group-management/mipeplimdkiijcfjjkdgkhemfcpoaied?hl=en&authuser=0). Alternativally you can download the source code for the extension. To add it to your extensions. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) (turn on developer mode in the top right corner if you don't already have it on) and select "Load unpacked". This should open a file prompt where you can select the folder for the extension. Once you have loaded the extension, you are all good to go.
